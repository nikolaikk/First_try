% "2D FDTD solution for Mur's Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC)"
% 
% Objective of the program is to solve for the Maxwell's equation for a TM 
% wave containing the xy-plane polarized magnetic field having components Hy
% and Hx and z-polarized electric field Ez. The fields are updated at every 
% timestep, in a space, where all physical parameters of free space are not
% normalized to 1 but are given real and known values. The update is done 
% using standard update equations obtained from the difference form of Maxwell's 
% curl equations with very low electric and magnetic conductivities of 4x10^(-4) 
% units incorporated in them. The field points are defined in a grid described 
% by Yee's algorithm. The H fields are defined at every half coordinate of 
% spacesteps. More precisely, the Hx part is defined at every half y-coordinate 
% and full x-coordinate and the Hy part is defined at every half x-coordinate 
% and full y-coordinate and E fields i.e the Ez part is defined at every full 
% x and full y-coordinate points.Also here, the space-step length is taken 
% as 1 micron instead of 1 unit in unitless domain assumed in previous programs. 
% Also, the time update is done using Leapfrog time-stepping. Here, H-fields
% i.e. Hx and Hy are updated every half time-step and E fields i.e Ez are 
% updated every full time-step. This is shown by two alternating vector updates 
% spanning only a part of spatial grid where the wave, starting from source, 
% has reached at that particular time instant avoiding field updates at all 
% points in the grid which is unnecessary at that time instant. These spatial 
% updates are inside the main for-loop for time update, spanning the entire 
% time grid. Also, here, the matrices used as multiplication factors for update 
% equations are initialized before the loop starts to avoid repeated calculation 
% of the same in every loop iteration, a minor attempt at optimization. The 
% boundary condition here is Mur's Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) where 
% the fields at the grid points have electric field values formulated using 
% Engquist Majda one way wave equations [1] where the boundaries give a sense 
% of absorbing the total field incident on them and reflecting none back to 
% the domain.
%
% A source of electric field is defined at the center of the spatial domain, 
% which is a hard source, in that it does not change its value due to 
% interference from external fields i.e in other words, the source is a 
% perfect electric conductor. The form of the source can be varied using 
% the variables sine, gaussian and impulse. The source is available in four 
% standard forms- Unit-time step, Impulse, Gausian and Sinusoidal forms. 
% The color scaled plot of Ez field over the entire spatial domain is shown 
% at every time step. The simulation can be ended by closing this plot window 
% or by waiting till all the time step updates are completed.
